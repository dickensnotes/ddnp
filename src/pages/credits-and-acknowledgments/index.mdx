## Acknowledgments

The project team is grateful for the support and assistance of the archivists at the National Art Library of the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, where most of Dickens’s manuscripts are held as part of the Forster Collection. Special thanks to Catherine Yvard and Douglas Dodds, and to the Board of Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

We are also grateful for the support and assistance of the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, which holds the _Our Mutual Friend_ manuscripts.

The project team is grateful for the generous support of an NEH Scholarly Editions and Translations Grant (2026-2027), which will enable the completion of this scholarly edition.

We would also like to acknowledge the support of Te Herenga Waka–Victoria University of Wellington; North Carolina State University Department of English; the Wimmer Family Foundation; Duquesne University’s NEH Endowment Fund; the Duke PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge; and NINES.

Finally, we extend our gratitude to John Bowen and Douglas Dodds for their input and assistance. Their [Deciphering Dickens Project](https://www.vam.ac.uk/research/projects/deciphering-dickens) is working to digitize and crowd-source transcriptions for the Dickens manuscripts (including the Working Notes) held at the V&A.
