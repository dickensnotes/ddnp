## From "Nobody's Fault" to "Little Dorrit"

Dickens had immense difficulty getting started on his new monthly novel in the spring and summer of 1855. In January he began jotting down ideas in a new _Memoranda_ book that, given the number of entries later marked “Done in Dorrit,” functions as an extension of the novel’s Working Notes. Despite this early planning, the novel that bore the title “Nobody’s Fault” through composition of the first three numbers (see LD.I) proved difficult to plan and write. 

A comparison between the first few Working Notes for _Little Dorrit_ and those for the prior four novels indicates Dickens’s level of uncertainty. His friend John Forster placed a facsimile of the Notes for Nos. I of _David Copperfield_ and _Little Dorrit_ side-by-side in his 1872 biography to illustrate “the labor and pains” of the _Little Dorrit_ Notes in comparison with the “lightness and confidence of handling” of those for _Copperfield_ (2.182). An even starker comparison can be made to the sparse early Notes for _Bleak House_, Dickens’s most recent monthly novel. The density of the _Little Dorrit_ Notes indicates just how heavily he relied on these pages to manage and work through–to “accept and reject”–his “ideas” (Letters 8.33).

The plethora of heterogeneous ideas Dickens generated for this novel explains his difficulty getting started. On May 8, 1855 he wrote to Angela Burdett-Coutts, complaining of a “state of restlessness impossible to be described–impossible to be imagined–wearing and tearing to be experienced. I sit down of a morning, with all kinds of notes for my new book” (Letters 7.613). His letters from the period repeatedly reiterate this same “restlessness." By May 24, he would report to Burdett-Coutts that his “condition of restlessness is not improved. All the symptoms are very bad. The only new feature is, that I am actually at work and in the middle of No. One” (7.629). The first installment would be published on November 30 1855, and would become an immediate bestseller, with 38,000 copies sold within a month (Slater 402). While his “wretchedness” (Letters 8.60) would subside as Dickens reached Nos. VII-X, it remained difficult to manage, and he still found his “knitted brows… turning to cordage over Little Dorrit” as late as his work on No. XVI in January 1857 (8.270).

Forster claims that the novel’s original title was tied to Dickens’s plan for “a leading man for a story who should bring about all the mischief in it, lay it all on Providence, and say at every fresh calamity, ‘Well, it's a mercy, however, nobody was to blame you know!’” (Forster 2.179). A note pertaining to this idea first appears in Dickens’s _Memoranda_ book (6) and features twice in the Working Notes, first for No. II (“The man who comfortably charges everything on Providence? Not yet,” LD.II.L3) and again in No. IV (LD.IV.L1). As Harvey Peter Sucksmith points out in his introduction to the comprehensive Clarendon edition, Dickens soon realized that “the notion of one man’s responsibility for all the mischief in the story clashed with his awareness that the condition of England must be blamed on a whole social, economic, and political scheme of things” (xx-xxi). Indeed, John Butt and Kathleen Tillotson are skeptical that Dickens ever intended for such a leading protagonist to encompass the critique implied by the original title (224). Dickens’s letters from this period repeatedly condemn the “failure” of representative government, especially in light of what he perceived as a mishandling of the Crimean War (Letters 7.713).He joined the Administrative Reform Association in June of 1855 and voiced his frustration at political mismanagement of the country in a number of _Household Words_ articles throughout the novel’s conception and composition.[^1]
