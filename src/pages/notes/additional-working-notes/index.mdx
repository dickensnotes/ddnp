## Expanding the DDNP

The Digital Dickens Notes Project is working to transcribe and annotate all of Charles Dickens’s Working Notes, beginning with _Bleak House_ (release date December 2022) and _David Copperfield_ (release date January 2023). 

The project will expand in mid-2023 to include the Working Notes and annotations for _Hard Times_ and _Little Dorrit_, with additional Notes to follow in 2024. 

This page details the surviving Working Notes and planning documents and explains our work in progress. 

## The Complete Working Notes

Dickens began the practice of keeping planning documents for his novels as early as 1840 with _The Old Curiosity Shop_, although it was not until 1846 with _Dombey and Son_ that he began his practice of organizing his Notes by installment. Complete sets of Working Notes survive for the following novels:

+ _Dombey and Son_ (1846-1848)
+ _David Copperfield_ (1849-50)
+ _Bleak House_ (1852-53)
+ _Hard Times_ (1854)
+ _Little Dorrit_ (1855-57)
+ _Our Mutual Friend_ (1864-65)

Of these, all but _Hard Times_ (published weekly in _Household Words_) were published in monthly numbers.

Working Notes also survive for the completed installments of _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_ (1870), as well as blank sheets for the prospective numbers of the planned twelve-number novel. Dickens died while he was working on Number IV of _Drood_; only sparse Notes exist for Numbers V and VI.

Planning documents also survive for the following novels, although they are not organized by installments:

+ _The Old Curiosity Shop_ (1840-41)
+ _Martin Chuzzlewit_ (1843-44)
+ _Great Expectations_ (1860-61)

## Existing Transcriptions

Dickens’s Working Notes are often transcribed as plain text in the appendix of a standard edition of the novel; examples include the Oxford World’s Classics editions of [_David Copperfield_](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/david-copperfield-9780199536290?q=david%20copperfield&lang=en&cc=nz) and [_Little Dorrit_](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/little-dorrit-9780199596485?q=little%20dorrit&lang=en&cc=nz). Such plain text transcriptions cannot represent non-textual markings or spatial properties of the page.

In 1987, Harry Stone published a complete set of transcriptions to all of Dickens’s Working Notes, alongside black-and-white facsimiles. This large book, published by University of Chicago Press (ISBN 978-0226145907), is now out of print.

In 2017, Tony Laing released the first digital edition of a set of Dickens’s Working Notes with his critical edition of the Notes for _Dombey and Son_. This [open-access edition](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/30825) contains color manuscript images and digital transcriptions, along with editorial commentary. Published by Open Book publishers, this free edition is an invaluable resource for scholars of Dickens’s composition. 

## Work in Progress

The Digital Dickens Notes Project Team is at work on transcriptions for _Hard Times_, _Little Dorrit_, and _Our Mutual Friend_. Our editorial annotations for these Notes are underway, and will help users grasp the progression of Dickens’s note-taking practices as his career progressed.

The Working Notes for _Hard Times_ demonstrate the development of Dickens’s use of the Notes as well as his reliance on what had become the customary structure of the monthly number. Following the successes of _Dombey and Son_, _David Copperfield_, and _Bleak House_, Dickens agreed to publish a shorter novel in weekly installments in _Household Words_ in 1854. The Working Notes for _Hard Times_ vividly illustrate Dickens’s difficulties in adjusting his approach to serial form, as he quickly reverted to conceiving and composing _Hard Times_ in the size of the monthly installment before dividing these into smaller segments for weekly publication. _Hard Times_ and its Working Notes, therefore, provide a unique glimpse into how Dickens’s creative process had come to be defined by the contours of the monthly number at this stage in his career.

The _Little Dorrit_ Notes offer a window into Dickens’s indecisions as he struggled to settle on a design for his new monthly novel. The early Notes demonstrate his uncertainty about his focus, providing insight into how Little Dorrit herself only gradually became central to a novel that initially began with the idea of a “man who comfortably charges everything on Providence” (LD_WN_02). The prevalence of imperative phrasal verbs ("work out," "work through," "carry on," etc) in the _Little Dorrit_ Working Notes also help us to see the Notes as generating formative energies for an installment. By this stage in his career, an installment comes to have properties of time and space through which Dickens can “carry” and “work” his characters.
