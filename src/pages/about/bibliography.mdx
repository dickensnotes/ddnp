---

This page provides a complete bibliography of sources referenced on the DDNP website, as well as a selection of titles and resources related to Dickens’s career and the Victorian serial novel. Given the vast amount of scholarship on these topics, this list is necessarily only partial. We will continue to add to and develop these lists as the project continues.

Each individual page on the DDNP website contains (where applicable) a complete works cited for items referenced on that page. We follow [MLA citation style](https://style.mla.org/works-cited/citations-by-format/), which uses in-text parenthetical citations. The citation includes the author’s last name and a page number that directs readers to the relevant item (and location within that item) in the works cited.

All references to Dickens’s letters are to the twelve-volume _Pilgrim Edition of the Letters of Charles Dickens_ (general editors: Madeline House, Graham Storey, and Kathleen Tillotson), published by Oxford University Press (1982-2002). Citations are given as (Letters [volume].[page number]) of this edition, although dates are usually also provided in text.

The works cited on the landing page of each set of Working Notes contains the bibliographic information for the version of the published novel cited on that page and in our annotations. We use trade editions published by Penguin Books or Oxford University Press, as these are widely available edited editions, but also reference the authoritative Clarendon Edition of Dickens’s novels (also published by Oxford University Press) where available and relevant. All of Dickens’s novels are available online in open-access (and searchable) editions through [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/58157/58157-h/58157-h.htm).
