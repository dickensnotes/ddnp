The Digital Dickens Notes Project (DDNP) strives to be minimal and sustainable, leveraging core web technologies and open standards as much as possible.

The site is built on [Astro](https://astro.build/), which optimizes for serving only as much Javascript as needed and supports frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/), which is necessary for [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/). We use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, as well as components from [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/).

We show transcriptions and annotations of the Working Notes with Mirador, which is a zoomable image viewer that leverages the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io/). Annotations were created in [Annonatate](https://annonatate.herokuapp.com/).

Search is powered by [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/).

The site is hosted on [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com/), and the [code](https://github.com/dickensnotes/ddnp) and [annotations](https://github.com/dickensnotes/dickens-annotations) live on [Github](https://github.com/).
