In early May, he declined several engagements, citing the oppressiveness of London in the summer months. To John de Gex on the 9th of May, for example, Dickens wrote: \"My attention is so fully occupied just now, that I am going to retreat for some months, early in June, to work in peace and quiet—an absolute impossibility in London at this time of the year when all the nations of the earth bring letters of introduction and Britannia is for ever asking her children out to all manner of social endurances” (Letters 7.82). In early June, though, Dickens was ill in bed for nearly a week, delaying his departure and his composition of No. XVII. On the 11th of June he wrote to Lady Eastlake from Folkestone: \"I have been ill and in great pain–six days in bed, for the first time in my life [...] Since Monday last, I have been shaving a man every morning–a stranger to me–with big gaunt eyes and a hollow cheek–whose appearance was rather irksome and oppressive\" (Letters 7.95). The Dickenses had a \"delightful passage\" on Sunday the 12th (Letters 7.98), with Dickens feeling \"immensely better\" and \"bracing [him]self up for the great attempt of Tuesday morning\" to begin writing the installment (Letters 7.96). His work appears to have progressed smoothly from there, as Dickens sent the \"lettering for the plates\" to Bradbury & Evans prior to beginning writing. On the 18th he reported to W.H. Wills: \"Thank God I have done half the No. with great ease, and hope to finish on Thursday or Friday next. O how thankful I feel to be able to have done it, and what a relief to get the No. out!\" (Letters 7.99). He appears to have indeed finished on Thursday the 23rd, writing playfully to Frank Stone at \"the earliest opportunity after finishing my Number\" to say that \"any person of undoubted pluck in want of a customer, may hear of me at the bar of Bleak House, where my money is down\" (Letters 7.100).

To John de Gex on the 9th of May, for example, Dickens wrote: \"My attention is so fully occupied just now, that I am going to retreat for some months, early in June, to work in peace and quiet—an absolute impossibility in London at this time of the year when all the nations of the earth bring letters of introduction and Britannia is for ever asking her children out to all manner of social endurances” (Letters 7.82). In early June, though, Dickens was ill in bed for nearly a week, delaying his departure and his composition of No. XVII. On the 11th of June he wrote to Lady Eastlake from Folkestone: \"I have been ill and in great pain–six days in bed, for the first time in my life [...] Since Monday last, I have been shaving a man every morning–a stranger to me–with big gaunt eyes and a hollow cheek–whose appearance was rather irksome and oppressive\" (Letters 7.95). The Dickenses had a \"delightful passage\" on Sunday the 12th (Letters 7.98), with Dickens feeling \"immensely better\" and \"bracing [him]self up for the great attempt of Tuesday morning\" to begin writing the installment (Letters 7.96). His work appears to have progressed smoothly from there, as Dickens sent the \"lettering for the plates\" to Bradbury & Evans prior to beginning writing. On the 18th he reported to W.H. Wills: \"Thank God I have done half the No. with great ease, and hope to finish on Thursday or Friday next. O how thankful I feel to be able to have done it, and what a relief to get the No. out!\" (Letters 7.99). He appears to have indeed finished on Thursday the 23rd, writing playfully to Frank Stone at \"the earliest opportunity after finishing my Number\" to say that \"any person of undoubted pluck in want of a customer, may hear of me at the bar of Bleak House, where my money is down\" (Letters 7.100).

Both Carey Street (west of Chancery Lane) and Dyer's Buildings (further east of Chancery Lane) are also nearby.  \n "},"58c22ae9-4d65-44b3-9999-24868efbb675.json":{"content":"BH.XVIII.L2\nEnding with the churchyard gate [...]\nThese memoranda offer a rare example of Dickens explicitly planning out the shape and structure of an entire number in these left-hand notes.

Most notably, George Henry Lewes criticized Dickens in an article in The Leader on December 11, 1852. While Dickens gathered more sources to bolster its plausibility through the coroner’s inquest in the following installment, Lewes published two more rebuttals in February, and he and Dickens continued to debate the matter in a private exchange of letters (see the Introduction to The Working Notes for Bleak House). Dickens revisited the issue and maintained his position in the novel’s Preface (written in August 1853 at the conclusion of the novel’s serial run): “There is only one other point on which I offer a word of remark. The possibility of what is called spontaneous combustion has been denied since the death of Mr. Krook; and my good friend Mr. Lewes (quite mistaken, as he soon found, in supposing the thing to have been abandoned by all authorities) published some ingenious letters to me at the time when that event was chronicled, arguing that spontaneous combustion could not possibly be.

The appearances, beyond all rational doubt, observed in that case are the appearances observed in Mr. Krook's case. The next most famous instance happened at Rheims six years earlier, and the historian in that case is Le Cat, one of the most renowned surgeons produced by France. The subject was a woman, whose husband was ignorantly convicted of having murdered her; but on solemn appeal to a higher court, he was acquitted because it was shown upon the evidence that she had died the death of which this name of spontaneous combustion is given. I do not think it necessary to add to these notable facts, and that general reference to the authorities which will be found at page 30, vol.

When Dickens began writing his first novel The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club in 1836, he was a twenty-four-year-old Parliamentary reporter who had managed to launch his writing career through short sketches of London life. While the initial monthly installments of Pickwick sold a mere four hundred copies, by the end of the novel’s serial run in 1837, nearly forty thousand copies of each installment were being sold.\n\nDickens’s subsequent novels built on and consolidated this success, and their serial publication shaped Dickens’s relationship and popularity with his Victorian audience. Although some of his novels were published in weekly installments in magazines that Dickens himself edited (such as Hard Times, which ran in Household Words from April to August 1854), most of his major novels were published in twenty installments that cost one-shilling and appeared monthly in their iconic blue-green covers (with the last installment being a double number).\n\nAlthough many readers encounter Dickens through paperback editions that indicate the division of the novel’s chapters into their monthly installments (usually 3-4 chapters per monthly number), it is difficult for contemporary readers to imagine reading and experiencing a novel unfolding in short installments, month-to-month, over the course of a year-and-a-half. It is perhaps even more difficult for us to imagine how seriality shaped Dickens’s creative practice, as he conceived, composed, and published his novels in these installments that were frequently finished on tight deadlines, shortly before they were published and read. The Working Notes he began keeping, therefore, provide unique insight into the dynamics of his compositional practice and open up new ways of interpreting the process of their serial development.\nWhat are the Working Notes?\n\nDickens began the practice of keeping complete sets of Working Notes for his novels in 1846 as he began to write Dombey and Son. These pages served as records of Dickens’s composition over the course of up to 19 months of serial writing and publication. He used the Notes to plan each installment and track storylines across multiple numbers, but he also returned to the pages multiple times before, during, and after the writing of a number. He used them, among other things, to conceive, consider, question, decide, document, prompt, and remember. These vital records of compositional practice demonstrate Victorian serial novel form in process.\nIn most cases, Dickens would divide in half a 7” x 9” sheet of paper for each serial installment, folding a crease down the middle of the page. On the right side, he wrote the title and installment number and divided this side of the page into chapter numbers. From the evidence that survives from the unfinished The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1870), we know that Dickens adopted the practice of creating a blank Working Note for each serial installment at the outset of a novel’s composition. He came back to fill in chapter titles and to jot down chief events and characters, occasional quotations, and memorable details. He used this space to test out names and phrases here and there, adding content over time, in some cases in cramped writing as space became short.\n\nDickens used the left side of the page for “generative” notes and memoranda for the installment as a whole, including long-term plans and motifs. Here we find questions about character combinations or plot details, often checked off or answered later in a different ink. At times he changes his mind. In some cases he uses this space to summarize work already completed or records his overwriting or underwriting of chapters and moves them around.\nComplete sets of these Notes survive for all Dickens’s monthly novels following Dombey and Son, including David Copperfield (1849-50), Bleak House (1852-53), Little Dorrit (1855-57), Our Mutual Friend (1864-65), and the completed installments of The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1870). Dickens also kept complete Notes for Hard Times (1854), which was published in weekly installments in Household Words. Planning documents and Notes also survive for The Old Curiosity Shop (1840-41), Martin Chuzzlewit (1843-44), and Great Expectations (1860-61), although they are not organized by installments.\nWhere are the Working Notes?\nDickens’s Working Notes are bound with his complete manuscripts in three libraries. The National Art Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London holds the majority of Dickens’s manuscripts, which the author bequeathed to his friend and biographer, John Forster (1812-76) in his will. These are part of the library’s large Foster Collection, bequeathed to the museum upon Forster’s death in 1876. (See Lowe, “The Conservation of Charles Dickens’ Manuscripts”).[^1]\n\nThe manuscript and Working Notes of Great Expectations are held at the Wisbech and Fenland Museum in Cambridgeshire, England. Dickens gave this manuscript to his friend Chauncy Hare Townshend (1798-1868), to whom he dedicated the novel. The two had been introduced by mesmerist John Elliotson in 1840. Townshend bequeathed the manuscript with additional materials to the Wisbech and Fenland Museum in 1868.\n\nThe Our Mutual Friend manuscript is held at the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. Dickens presented this manuscript to Eneas Sweetland Dallas (1828-79) in January 1866 as a token of appreciation for Dallas’s favorable review of the novel in The Times (Nov. 25, 1865). The manuscript found its way from E.S. Dallas to George W. Childs in Philadelphia, who donated it to the Drexel Institute of Technology. It was subsequently purchased by the Morgan Library in October, 1944.\nThe Digital Dickens Notes Project\nWhile scholars have long recognized Dickens’s Working Notes as important resources for understanding the author’s writing process, their significance has been underappreciated. This is in part due to the difficulty of capturing their complex and dynamic relationship to Dickens’s compositional practices. Transcriptions of these Notes are often reproduced in the appendices to trade editions, but these black-and-white linear reproductions fail to capture the richness of these manuscripts: the size, color, and placement of elements on the page, the non-textual markings Dickens used for emphasis and to record the process of his writing at various stages.

Web. http://dickensnotes.com/introduction/general/\n\nSerial Composition: Writing in Parts\nThe Digital Dickens Notes Project (DDNP) uses the Working Notes Charles Dickens kept for his novels after 1846 to offer a new approach to the study of these major Victorian texts and the serial form they epitomize. By immersing users in Dickens’s compositional practice over many months of serial writing, and in the iterative development of a serial novel’s form over time, the DDNP foregrounds process in reading and analyzing Dickens’s novels.\nAs readers and scholars, we typically approach Dickens’s compositional practice—and serial form more broadly—almost necessarily anchored in a position of retrospection; we look back from the vantage of the completed novel, with knowledge of the full arc of Dickens’s career, which is itself remediated through the substantial body of scholarship his works have generated.\nBut all of Dickens’s novels were—until the final installment was written and published—novels in process. They were open-ended and indeterminate, yet also delimited by the foundations laid in the preceding installments, as well as by the predetermined length of the individual installment and overall number of installments. Even amongst many contemporaries who published serially, Dickens’s novels were uniquely defined by the material circumstances of serial publication. For his novels published in monthly installments, each number was composed, revised, typeset, edited, printed, published, sold, then read (and even reviewed) by the public in discrete serial parts over the course of nineteen months.\n\nSerial form not only structured Dickens’s compositional habits as a novelist, but shaped the contours of his other professional commitments and the rhythms of his personal life. By the time Dickens came to write Hard Times for publication in Household Words in 1854, he found himself needing to conceive and compose the novel—as the Working Notes vividly illustrate—in the standard monthly installment size he had become accustomed to, before dividing those into smaller segments for weekly publication.\nThe Working Notes are evidence and a robust material record of Dickens’s navigation of serial production. The complete sets of Notes—both for individual novels and across multiple novels from Dombey and Son (1846-48) onwards—enable us to look back, retrospectively, and trace developments in Dickens’s craft. But the Notes, we believe, can also activate the contingency of serial composition and reanimate our engagement with the processual nature of Dickensian serial form.\nTo take a basic but illustrative example: the left-hand memoranda of many Working Notes show Dickens posing questions to himself, frequently about the potential inclusion of specific characters in a given number, followed by answers that are (very frequently) in a clearly different ink or nib. These inscriptions on the Notes—query, followed by answer—are traces of the temporal distension of Dickens’s compositional process. Read alongside the often heavily edited manuscript pages of the novel, they cultivate a sense of potentiality and counterfactual possibilities within each number, as Dickens moves month by month from initial conception to completed novel. The Working Notes, in other words, offer us a point of engagement with Dickens’s serial novels that unsettles the finality of the published number or the completed novel.\n\nPattern and Process: Dickens as Story-Weaver\nThe tension between finished form and compositional process was central to Dickens’s own experience of his serial novels. In his prefaces, which he wrote immediately after finishing a novel, he often used the metaphor of weaving to name the conflicting pressures of the “general purpose and design” and “the temptation of the current monthly number” (Martin Chuzzlewit 5). In the preface to Little Dorrit (1855-57) (xxi), for instance, he made this plea to his readers:\n[A]s it is not unreasonable to suppose that I may have held [the work’s] threads with a more continuous attention than anyone else can have given them during its desultory publication, it is not unreasonable to ask that the weaving may be looked at in its completed state, and with the pattern finished.\nAnd in the “Postscript in lieu of a preface” to Our Mutual Friend (1864-65) (821), he repeated this weaving metaphor:\nIts difficulty was much enhanced by the mode of publication; for, it would be very unreasonable to expect that many readers, pursuing the story in portions month by month through nineteen months, will, until they have it before them complete, perceive the relations of its finer threads to the whole pattern which is always before the eyes of the story-weaver at his loom.\nIn approaching Dickens’s texts via their temporally expansive composition, the DDNP takes seriously the tensions Dickens names between pattern and process, between prospection and retrospection, between complete form and serial formation, between weaving (noun) and weaving (verb).\n\nThe Working Notes, illuminated by the DDNP’s annotations, can indeed help us perceive the “whole pattern” of a long, dense, overpopulated novel via as little as 19 pages of text, drawing attention to the carefully crafted, interwoven threads of plot. But they can also allow us to immerse ourselves in the “finer threads” that weave across, loop back, and interlace between the space and time of serial installments. We can notice as the weaver drops threads, changes his mind, and alters the pattern.\nExploring Seriality with the DDNP: Transcriptions and Annotations\nTo facilitate this engagement with Dickens’s serial practice, the DDNP offers users legible, spatially accurate transcriptions of the Working Notes with robust editorial annotations.\nThe DDNP’s transcriptions aim to translate the materiality of the Working Notes into digital images. Our transcription practices take into account not just the legible textual content of the Notes; we take just as seriously the spatial and visual properties of the page. In rendering non-textual markings (underlining, deletions, and check marks), and in preserving the layout of each manuscript page while making Dickens’s handwriting accessible, we aim to facilitate rich close reading of these compositional records. Immersing readers in Dickens’s multiple engagements with the page, our transcriptions turn these texts into dynamic spaces. Users can zoom in and out of transcriptions to examine the Notes in detail and compare the Notes’ content across novels. (For more on the creation of our transcriptions, see Editing the Notes (https://dickensnotes.com/about/editing-the-notes/))\nThe DDNP’s editorial annotations are the product of detailed archival research and provide an immersive engagement with Dickens’s compositional process and serial novel formation. Based on an examination of the Working Note manuscripts alongside many other archival traces of Dickens’s writing process—including his memoranda book, letters, the densely interlineated novel manuscripts, multiple sets of edited and corrected proofs, and the published installments of each novel—our annotations draw attention to the dynamics of serial composition.\n\nIn an attempt to access the “layers” of Dickens’s engagement with these Notes over time, we compare changes of ink in the Notes to the manuscripts and edited proofs; place changes and emendations in the Notes in the context of events in Dickens’s life made evident in his letters; and trace deletions, additions, and emendations across the multiple compositional documents (manuscript, multiple edited proofs) to understand the order and the manner with which Dickens used these pages. In many instances, analysis of the Working Notes enables us to establish plausible, though not necessarily conclusive, interpretations of the temporal relationship between the content on the Notes and the composition of the text. For example, evidence provided by the manuscripts and corrected proofs—such as changes to a character’s name within the manuscript pages, or the addition of a title in ink to the corrected proofs—confirms how Dickens used the Working Notes to record decisions or details after completing the composition of a given serial installment.\nIn addition to drawing attention to temporal layers and elements of compositional practice, our annotations also treat the Working Notes as interpretive tools for approaching Dickens’s novels. Notes can illuminate thematic elements of a novel, indicate the relationships between or handling of certain characters, and shed light on pacing and plot developments. Cumulatively, the annotations contribute to the DDNP’s efforts to cultivate an appreciation for the dynamism and open-endedness of Dickens’s compositional process, even as his career progressed.\nDynamic Records of Serial Process: Scholarly Approach\nAt the heart of this project is the conviction that the Working Notes are invaluable windows into the workings—the mechanisms, operations, and activities—of Dickens’s serial novel form. Our close inspection of the Working Notes alongside these supporting documents demonstrates that the Note system was critical to Dickens’s management of narrative over time, across a novel’s nineteen-month serial run. While the Notes often served planning purposes, helping Dickens think prospectively about what must be included in a given or future installment, they just as often served as retrospective records of what had already been accomplished. For instance, there are several instances where, after adding or emending a chapter title in proof, Dickens fails to make the change on the manuscript, but does return to add the new title to the Working Note. This suggests that he intended each Working Note to be an important distillation of a serial installment, and that he carried the Notes forward into subsequent months as important points of reference.\nOur scholarly approach to Dickens’s Notes is thus a departure from traditional forms of scholarly engagement with the Notes, which have often been read as a residual trace of Dickens’s attention to design. The notes have been described as “number plans,” “blueprint[s],” “worksheet[s],” and “reminders,” as evidence of “authorial intention” and “systematic planning” and as “ingredients for a particular number.”[^1] While Harry Stone (editor of the only complete scholarly edition of the Notes published in 1987) and others frequently acknowledge the complex temporality of the notes,[^2] their position in Dickens scholarship to this point has been most often as illustration for Dickens’s increasing commitment to coherence and formal unity as his career progressed.[^3]\nBut a closer engagement with the materiality of the Working Notes, and examination of these documents alongside the many records of Dickens’s serial composition, offers a much more dynamic picture of their complex temporality. Documents of process as well as pattern, they reveal both the constraints of the serial installment and the indeterminacies and openness of serial temporality. In Serial Forms Clare Pettitt reads seriality as an “exceptionally, perhaps even dangerously, flexible form” that can be both “emancipatory” and “regulatory”; it can produce restraint as well as freedom, systematization as well as dynamism (Pettitt 6-8). As a unique record of Dickens’s compositional process and practice, his Working Notes enable us to explore his navigation of serial form from Dombey and Son through the completed numbers of The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1870).\nGiven the inconsistency of Dickens’s practice with the Notes across a single novel, it is apparent that the Working Notes did not function as mere blueprints or even simple summaries. If Dickens, as the self-fashioned “story-weaver at his loom,” imagined his novels containing many threads that weave in and out, through and between, the Notes offer access to the texture of a work. They capture and visualize a dynamic back-and-forth movement between artistic compulsions–to plan, document, visualize, and reflect. The Notes are experimental spaces where Dickens laid down ideas for a number, fairly indiscriminately; later returned to make additions and changes; and finally recorded what had been “worked out” in the writing process. Consequently, the Notes seem to have provided him, month by month, with a sense of the shape of the novel-in-process, offering opportunities to reconsider what each new decision or development might mean for the installments yet-to-come. To this end, they act as crucial containers for the imaginative and creative labor Dickens performed in his manuscripts.\nAs we explain in our Editorial Methodology (https://www.dickensnotes.com/about/editing-the-notes/), our Project aims to immerse readers in the serial temporality and the material complexity of these compositional documents.

By immersing users in Dickens’s compositional practice over many months of serial writing, and in the iterative development of a serial novel’s form over time, the DDNP foregrounds process in reading and analyzing Dickens’s novels.\nAs readers and scholars, we typically approach Dickens’s compositional practice—and serial form more broadly—almost necessarily anchored in a position of retrospection; we look back from the vantage of the completed novel, with knowledge of the full arc of Dickens’s career, which is itself remediated through the substantial body of scholarship his works have generated.\nBut all of Dickens’s novels were—until the final installment was written and published—novels in process. They were open-ended and indeterminate, yet also delimited by the foundations laid in the preceding installments, as well as by the predetermined length of the individual installment and overall number of installments. Even amongst many contemporaries who published serially, Dickens’s novels were uniquely defined by the material circumstances of serial publication. For his novels published in monthly installments, each number was composed, revised, typeset, edited, printed, published, sold, then read (and even reviewed) by the public in discrete serial parts over the course of nineteen months.\n\nSerial form not only structured Dickens’s compositional habits as a novelist, but shaped the contours of his other professional commitments and the rhythms of his personal life. By the time Dickens came to write Hard Times for publication in Household Words in 1854, he found himself needing to conceive and compose the novel—as the Working Notes vividly illustrate—in the standard monthly installment size he had become accustomed to, before dividing those into smaller segments for weekly publication.\nThe Working Notes are evidence and a robust material record of Dickens’s navigation of serial production.

Whether it’s keeping track of a vast network of characters, grappling with multiple narrative threads, or understanding how a novel’s serial publication might influence our understanding of its form, students often struggle to grasp the complexity of Dickens’s longer serial novels.\nThe Working Notes offer a unique means of addressing and accessing this textual complexity. In as little as nineteen pages, the Notes can function as an index to the form and content of an 800-page text. Whether incorporated into a formal assignment or used as a reference point for class discussion, these texts can help students understand Dickens’s compositional practice, the constraints and affordances of serial form, the cultural significance of serial publication, and the unique movement of plot and character through multiple installments across many months.\nRecent scholarship on teaching Victorian literature has championed approaches that help students experience what it meant to be a Victorian reader or writer of serial fiction. While some instructors simulate Victorian serial consumption via the serial assignment of reading across the course of a semester (Tange), others experiment with having students become part of reading communities (Cook and Henley), or imagine the composition of Edwin Drood’s unfinished parts (Chavez and Hauhart).\nThe approach made possible by the Working Notes is unique in its use of these short texts as windows into a novel’s serial form and composition. Each page of Notes can become an access point to understanding what Daniel Siegel has called the “architectural” nature of a single installment–its shape, pacing, handling of characters, and relationship to other installments and the novel as a whole. Students can use the Notes to reconsider the novel’s plot development, character networks, and serial structure. And, by engaging with texts kept as an author’s personal records, students can debate the value of taking authorial intention and compositional process into account when interpreting a literary text.\nThe DDNP’s legible, spatially faithful, easy-to-navigate transcriptions of the Working Notes allow students to engage with these texts in much more nuanced ways than the transcriptions in the appendix of a popular press edition can allow. As a tool for practicing close reading, these transcriptions can help students engage in interpretations that go beyond language to consider space, non-textual markings, and evidence of compositional decision-making: placement on the page, ink color, emphases, questions and later answers, deletions, and emendations. The DDNP’s introductions and annotations offer further material to aid–but not determine–students’ interpretive engagements with the Notes.\nBelow find an example in-class discussion activity and an assignment that can be adapted for use with any set of Working Notes.\nExample Classroom Activity\nThe following in-class activity can be adapted for use with one page of the Working Notes or by assigning the Working Note from one installment to each group.\nNote that, because Dickens used these pages to plan ahead as well as to record his progress and consider new possibilities, the Working Notes often contain “spoilers” for future developments in a text. Instructors may want to keep this in mind when assigning the Notes for an activity before students have completed a novel.\nInstructions\nIn groups, close-read the assigned double-page of the Working Notes.\nPay attention to the language Dickens uses to refer to elements of the installment’s plot, his characters, and his composition of the novel. What stands out to you in Dickens’s choice of words? How do they relate to the text of the installment?\nLook beyond the words to consider Dickens’s use of the page, any obvious changes in ink color, the use of questions and answers, non-textual markings, deletions and changes. What might these add to your close reading?\nBased on what you notice, what do you think this text can help you understand about the published installment of the novel?\nDoes it help you see anything in a new way?\nHow does the Note help you consider the role this installment plays in the novel as a whole?\nWhat might the Note help us understand about Dickens’s composition of his novel?\nExample Assignment\nThe Working Notes can also be used to structure assignments. The following assignment was designed by Anna Gibson for her 2020 English honors course at North Carolina State University, in which each student was assigned the Working Note to a single serial part of Bleak House. This two-part assignment asks students to first annotate their assigned Working Notes and then write an accompanying essay about the significance of the corresponding serial part as illuminated by the Notes. Since this assignment used an early version of the DDNP’s Bleak House Working Notes transcriptions, students were provided with a PDF and used the hypothes.is annotation tool to create their annotations.\n\nWorks Cited\nChavez, Julia McCord and Robert C.

Anna Gibson and Adam Grener, dirs. 2022. Web.\n  http://dickensnotes.com/about/editing-the-notes/\n\nEditorial Methodology\nThe DDNP aims to cultivate appreciation of the complex and dynamic relationship between Dickens’s Working Notes and his completed novels. This aim emerges from our recognition of the material richness of the Notes, as we have encountered them in their archival setting. While the DDNP cannot replicate the materiality of the Notes, our methodology leverages the digital environment to translate the materiality of the Working Notes into an encounter online (for more information about Dickens’s manuscripts, see the General Introduction (https://wwww.dickensnotes.com/introduction/general/)).\nThe DDNP’s presentation of each set of Working Notes–our transcriptions, as well as our annotations and scholarly introductions–is the result of extensive archival research. Our attention to the manuscript pages of the Working Notes is supported by careful comparative analysis of the manuscripts and corrected proofs of the novels they accompany.\nOur transcriptions are digital translations–of handwriting into typeset text, of paper and ink into image–that require decisions about how to capture and communicate material facets of the Notes. We have developed and followed a consistent set of principles across all of our transcriptions, and detail the rationale behind those decisions on this page.\nA member of the DDNP project team is the lead author for the annotations and critical introduction that accompany each set of transcribed Working Notes. All material, though, has been subjected to editorial review by other members of the team and is thus the result of shared insights, scholarly conversation, and collaboration. Although our annotation practices follow a shared philosophy, each set of annotations develop distinct insights and interpretations. This is the consequence not only of the particularities of each novel and Dickens’s changing use of the Working Notes over time, but also of our different sensibilities as readers and scholars of Dickens’s works.\nThe DDNP will begin by presenting the transcriptions of the Working Notes for David Copperfield and Bleak House, with annotations and scholarly introduction for the latter. Annotations and the introduction to the Notes for Copperfield will follow shortly in early 2023. The DDNP will add transcriptions, annotations, and introductions to the Working Notes ofHard Times and Little Dorrit by mid-2023, and then turn attention to the remaining sets of complete Notes for Dombey and Son, Our Mutual Friend, and the unfinished The Mystery of Edwin Drood.\nTranscribing the Working Notes\nIn almost all instances, our text transcriptions agree with Harry Stone’s, although there are some instances (indicated in annotations) where we offer minor corrections or where our rendering of capitalization or punctuation differs from Stone’s. There are also places where we cannot confirm his more speculative interpretations of deleted text; here, we present the deletions as they appear on the page, simply as non-textual markings.\nTranscribing Dickens’s Working Notes as a combination of typographical text and digitally rendered non-textual markings involves a number of editorial decisions.\nInk Colors\nThe vagaries of ink color are the most difficult aspect of the Working Notes to transcribe. Dickens used many types of black and blue ink throughout his career, and often several different inks within the composition of a given number. A comparison of Dickens’s ink use with biographical records indicates that changes in ink were often related to changes in Dickens’s routine; he often used a different ink or pen while traveling. In some instances, oxidation has rendered Dickens’s black iron-gall ink a brownish color. In other instances, the Notes are rendered in various shades of blue ink.\n\nOur transcriptions render the most obvious changes in ink color–for example, a change between blue and black ink on one page–but do not attempt to translate more subtle differences. While such differences in ink weight or shade are visible on the Notes and can provide evidence of distinct layers, they do not offer sufficient evidence on their own, since they may be the result of changes to the quill or the cut of the nib; redipping in ink; variations in ink flow or in the pressure, speed, or angle of writing; and subsequent corrosion of the ink due to oxidation over time.\nWhere subtle changes in ink color or density inform our interpretation of the Notes’ temporality, those changes are indicated in our annotations, but not in the transcriptions.\nFor a more detailed analysis of Dickens’s use of inks and the consistency and progression of density and corrosion, see Tony Laing’s in-depth explanation (18-23).\nCapitalization and Superscript\nThe uniformity of typeset text cannot replicate the irregularities of the written hand, but our transcriptions attempt to capture the variability of Dickens’s writing on individual pages.\nDickens’s handwriting often renders certain letters–particularly C, A, W, P, and O–as indeterminately upper or lower case. At times, for instance, an initial C may appear to be larger than the proceeding letters in the word, whereas in other instances the height of the C appears consistent with that of the following lowercase letters (for instance, in Dickens’s varying depiction of the initial C in “chapter”). Deciding how to render these in text transcriptions is complicated by the need to choose between one of two case sizes, a decision that was undoubtedly challenging for Dickens’s typesetters. While the typesetters could rely upon context and convention for the publication of a text for a public readership, Dickens’s notes were intended only for personal use, so our editorial decisions are based on both context and our assessment of the relative size of the surrounding letters. Here are the practices we follow:\nProper Names - Proper names of characters are rendered with an initial uppercase capital letter (e.g. Arthur Clennam) even when the A, C, or W might be interpreted as lowercase. Other proper names of places (e.g. “Tom-all-Alone’s”) are rendered according to our best approximation of the relative size of Dickens’s handwriting, even though the typesetters regularized the capitalization.\n\nChapter Headings - Dickens is very inconsistent with his capitalization of “Chapter” in his chapter headings. In most cases, the initial “c” is shorter than the ascender of the following h, making most of these appear to be lowercase letters. However, since some instances do appear to be larger, we have largely followed Stone’ practice of capitalizing these, except where the difference seemed too arbitrary.\nChapter Titles - Chapter titles are rendered according to our best approximation of the hand. Because Dickens occasionally configured letters that have very different upper- and lower-cases, even in handwriting (e.g. “D/d” and “B/b”), as lowercase in chapter titles, we can assume that he was somewhat inconsistent with his capitalization of titles.\nAbbreviations - In some cases, Dickens’s position of letters in abbreviations (e.g. Mrs, Miss, Dr, qy) might tempt us to render all but the first letter as superscript (a practice adopted by Harry Stone), but unless all letters but the first are clearly raised and significantly smaller than the initial letter, we have used font size to render this difference.\nNon-textual markings\nAt the heart of our transcription approach is a faithful rendering of all non-textual markings on these manuscripts, since these dashes, lines, emphases, and deletions offer unique insights into the function and use of these pages. Our transcriptions render all legible handwriting as typewritten text, but we have carefully reconstructed the pixels of all additional ink markings on the pages. The most common instances of non-textual markings include:\nDiagonal lines - Dickens uses diagonal slashes throughout the notes, often to separate entries that pertain to different topics, plot elements, or ideas. In most instances, these lines rise from the lower left to the upper right. They vary in length, but are often short enough that they become difficult to distinguish from em-dashes, and in certain instances they could be interpreted as underlinings, since Dickens often underlined words at a slight angle.\nUnderlinings - Dickens usually underlines chapter headings and titles, often with a set of three double strokes. In other cases he uses underlining for emphasis.\nMiscellaneous markings - These include lines that connect entries across space on the page; lines used to separate text associated with one chapter when it runs down into another chapter’s allocated space; accidental marks, such as ink blots, and other unidentifiable markings. In some cases, we have rendered in Dickens’s hand marks that could be interpreted as text, but are too illegible to transcribe with certainty.\nDeletions\nThe Working Notes occasionally contain deletions, where Dickens has crossed through a word or words, usually with a looped line or, less frequently, with cross-hatching. These deletions, however, appear much more frequently in the manuscripts themselves, and so deleted text is not a prominent feature of the Working Notes.\nThe DDNP transcriptions capture these deletions. Where the deleted word is illegible or indecipherable, no attempt is made to capture the writing beneath. Where deleted words are legible they have been transcribed, and the deletion itself has been captured but rendered partially transparent so that the text beneath can be read. In most instances, our transcription of deleted words match those of Harry Stone, although there are a number of instances where we cannot confirm his text transcriptions of deleted words that we feel are speculative.\nNovel and Number Plan Headings\nIn order to offer a visual representation of Dickens’s handwriting and to demonstrate the relationship between our textual transcriptions and the manuscript text, we have rendered the novel and number plan heading in the top-right as it appears in the manuscript, in Dickens’s hand.\nTranscription Process\nThe DDNP presents transcriptions of each sheet of Working Notes as a single image in order to capture Dickens’s use of these pages in the process of composition. In translating the materiality of the Working Note into a digital image, our transcriptions aim to make the text of each Working Note clearly legible while also communicating the spatial and visual properties of the Working Notes.\nTranscriptions are created in Adobe Photoshop and generally comprise two layers. The first layer captures the text of the Note. This text, once transcribed, is placed on the page so as to resemble its size and location on the Working Note. Dickens’s handwriting across the Working Notes is inconsistent, both in terms of the size of individual words and also the size of letters within single words. An exaggerated capital letter at the start of a word, for example, or a particularly elaborate descender in a letter (e.g., g, j, p, q, y) can distort the perceived size of a given word. \nDickens’s handwriting is similarly inconsistent in its width across the Working Notes; this is the consequence both of the irregularities of his hand and of the spatial properties of the Notes themselves, as words are frequently compressed into the space allotted to a given chapter or the margins of the sheet itself. While adjustments to font size and kerning (the space between letters) offers flexibility, the regularity of typographical text cannot replicate the irregularities of handwriting. Our transcriptions, therefore, adjust size and kerning to approximate the average size of a word or phrase on the Working Notes. Likewise, the placement of text on the page at an angle or slope aims to capture these variations in Dickens’s handwriting on individual Notes.\n\nDickens’s handwriting across the Working Notes is consistently far more legible than in the manuscript pages themselves, but at times the writing on particular sheets (or places within sheets) can appear visibly more sloppy or rushed. These variations cannot be captured typographically, but can be identified in editorial annotations. \nThe second layer of the transcription comprises its non-textual markings: underlines, checks, lines of emphasis, and other non-typographical marks. These marks are hand-drawn and again aim to capture their size and placement on the page of Notes. Dickens’s dashes are particularly inconsistent, both in terms of length and vertical placement (some might be interpreted as underscores). However, in the interests of legibility and consistency, these have been rendered in type as em-dashes in the font size of surrounding text. Similarly, Dickens’s question marks and even full-stops display interesting variations, but have been rendered uniformly in type for clarity.\nAnnotating the Working Notes\nThe DDNP’s annotations aim to draw out and illustrate Dickens’s complex and irregular use of the Working Notes. They do so by attending to the material richness of the manuscript pages in their archival settings, and by interpreting the Working Notes alongside the manuscript, the corrected proofs, and the final published text of the novel, as well as other paratextual material–such as letters and biographical information–that might shed light on Dickens’s compositional process.\nAs our Scholarly Introduction (https://wwww.dickensnotes.com/introduction/scholarly/) explains, the DDNP foregrounds process in reading and analyzing Dickens’s serial form. Our annotations of the Working Notes are guided by this methodological commitment, but they attend to many different facets of the processural nature of serial form.\nSome annotations are primarily descriptive and explicate features of the Working Note that may only be legible in their archival setting, such as when a different in ink or nib might indicate a distinct engagement with the note by Dickens (e.g., a reply to a query that is clearly made at a later time).\nOther annotations interpret the content of the Working Notes alongside the manuscript or corrected proofs. For example, some annotations describe how a name or phrase that appears on the Working Note is actually something Dickens arrives at through drafting and revision in the manuscript itself; this would suggest that the note is a record of a decision made in the process of composition, rather than a decision that preceded composition.\nSome annotations anchor a given serial installment in its moment of production by, for instance, providing relevant biographical information about Dickens’s movements or activities during a given period.\nFinally, some annotations interpret the Working Notes within the context of the novel as a whole, identifying patterns that suggest Dickens’s particular attention to a group of characters or plot thread, or interpreting notes as evidence of developments that Dickens considered or rejected.\nWhile each set of annotations is governed by consistent scholarly practices, they do not attempt to offer definitive interpretations of the significance of the Working Notes themselves. Rather, the descriptive, editorial, and interpretive commentary provided by the DDNP’s annotations provides users with new ways to access and explore Dickens’s compositional process and serial novels.\nWorks Cited\nLaing, Tony.

At times, for instance, an initial C may appear to be larger than the proceeding letters in the word, whereas in other instances the height of the C appears consistent with that of the following lowercase letters (for instance, in Dickens’s varying depiction of the initial C in “chapter”). Deciding how to render these in text transcriptions is complicated by the need to choose between one of two case sizes, a decision that was undoubtedly challenging for Dickens’s typesetters. While the typesetters could rely upon context and convention for the publication of a text for a public readership, Dickens’s notes were intended only for personal use, so our editorial decisions are based on both context and our assessment of the relative size of the surrounding letters. Here are the practices we follow:\nProper Names - Proper names of characters are rendered with an initial uppercase capital letter (e.g. Arthur Clennam) even when the A, C, or W might be interpreted as lowercase. Other proper names of places (e.g. “Tom-all-Alone’s”) are rendered according to our best approximation of the relative size of Dickens’s handwriting, even though the typesetters regularized the capitalization.\n\nChapter Headings - Dickens is very inconsistent with his capitalization of “Chapter” in his chapter headings. In most cases, the initial “c” is shorter than the ascender of the following h, making most of these appear to be lowercase letters. However, since some instances do appear to be larger, we have largely followed Stone’ practice of capitalizing these, except where the difference seemed too arbitrary.\nChapter Titles - Chapter titles are rendered according to our best approximation of the hand. Because Dickens occasionally configured letters that have very different upper- and lower-cases, even in handwriting (e.g. “D/d” and “B/b”), as lowercase in chapter titles, we can assume that he was somewhat inconsistent with his capitalization of titles.\nAbbreviations - In some cases, Dickens’s position of letters in abbreviations (e.g. Mrs, Miss, Dr, qy) might tempt us to render all but the first letter as superscript (a practice adopted by Harry Stone), but unless all letters but the first are clearly raised and significantly smaller than the initial letter, we have used font size to render this difference.\nNon-textual markings\nAt the heart of our transcription approach is a faithful rendering of all non-textual markings on these manuscripts, since these dashes, lines, emphases, and deletions offer unique insights into the function and use of these pages. Our transcriptions render all legible handwriting as typewritten text, but we have carefully reconstructed the pixels of all additional ink markings on the pages. The most common instances of non-textual markings include:\nDiagonal lines - Dickens uses diagonal slashes throughout the notes, often to separate entries that pertain to different topics, plot elements, or ideas. In most instances, these lines rise from the lower left to the upper right. They vary in length, but are often short enough that they become difficult to distinguish from em-dashes, and in certain instances they could be interpreted as underlinings, since Dickens often underlined words at a slight angle.\nUnderlinings - Dickens usually underlines chapter headings and titles, often with a set of three double strokes. In other cases he uses underlining for emphasis.\nMiscellaneous markings - These include lines that connect entries across space on the page; lines used to separate text associated with one chapter when it runs down into another chapter’s allocated space; accidental marks, such as ink blots, and other unidentifiable markings. In some cases, we have rendered in Dickens’s hand marks that could be interpreted as text, but are too illegible to transcribe with certainty.\nDeletions\nThe Working Notes occasionally contain deletions, where Dickens has crossed through a word or words, usually with a looped line or, less frequently, with cross-hatching. These deletions, however, appear much more frequently in the manuscripts themselves, and so deleted text is not a prominent feature of the Working Notes.\nThe DDNP transcriptions capture these deletions. Where the deleted word is illegible or indecipherable, no attempt is made to capture the writing beneath. Where deleted words are legible they have been transcribed, and the deletion itself has been captured but rendered partially transparent so that the text beneath can be read. In most instances, our transcription of deleted words match those of Harry Stone, although there are a number of instances where we cannot confirm his text transcriptions of deleted words that we feel are speculative.\nNovel and Number Plan Headings\nIn order to offer a visual representation of Dickens’s handwriting and to demonstrate the relationship between our textual transcriptions and the manuscript text, we have rendered the novel and number plan heading in the top-right as it appears in the manuscript, in Dickens’s hand.\nTranscription Process\nThe DDNP presents transcriptions of each sheet of Working Notes as a single image in order to capture Dickens’s use of these pages in the process of composition. In translating the materiality of the Working Note into a digital image, our transcriptions aim to make the text of each Working Note clearly legible while also communicating the spatial and visual properties of the Working Notes.\nTranscriptions are created in Adobe Photoshop and generally comprise two layers. The first layer captures the text of the Note. This text, once transcribed, is placed on the page so as to resemble its size and location on the Working Note. Dickens’s handwriting across the Working Notes is inconsistent, both in terms of the size of individual words and also the size of letters within single words. An exaggerated capital letter at the start of a word, for example, or a particularly elaborate descender in a letter (e.g., g, j, p, q, y) can distort the perceived size of a given word. \nDickens’s handwriting is similarly inconsistent in its width across the Working Notes; this is the consequence both of the irregularities of his hand and of the spatial properties of the Notes themselves, as words are frequently compressed into the space allotted to a given chapter or the margins of the sheet itself. While adjustments to font size and kerning (the space between letters) offers flexibility, the regularity of typographical text cannot replicate the irregularities of handwriting. Our transcriptions, therefore, adjust size and kerning to approximate the average size of a word or phrase on the Working Notes. Likewise, the placement of text on the page at an angle or slope aims to capture these variations in Dickens’s handwriting on individual Notes.\n\nDickens’s handwriting across the Working Notes is consistently far more legible than in the manuscript pages themselves, but at times the writing on particular sheets (or places within sheets) can appear visibly more sloppy or rushed. These variations cannot be captured typographically, but can be identified in editorial annotations. \nThe second layer of the transcription comprises its non-textual markings: underlines, checks, lines of emphasis, and other non-typographical marks. These marks are hand-drawn and again aim to capture their size and placement on the page of Notes. Dickens’s dashes are particularly inconsistent, both in terms of length and vertical placement (some might be interpreted as underscores). However, in the interests of legibility and consistency, these have been rendered in type as em-dashes in the font size of surrounding text. Similarly, Dickens’s question marks and even full-stops display interesting variations, but have been rendered uniformly in type for clarity.\nAnnotating the Working Notes\nThe DDNP’s annotations aim to draw out and illustrate Dickens’s complex and irregular use of the Working Notes. They do so by attending to the material richness of the manuscript pages in their archival settings, and by interpreting the Working Notes alongside the manuscript, the corrected proofs, and the final published text of the novel, as well as other paratextual material–such as letters and biographical information–that might shed light on Dickens’s compositional process.\nAs our Scholarly Introduction (https://wwww.dickensnotes.com/introduction/scholarly/) explains, the DDNP foregrounds process in reading and analyzing Dickens’s serial form. Our annotations of the Working Notes are guided by this methodological commitment, but they attend to many different facets of the processural nature of serial form.\nSome annotations are primarily descriptive and explicate features of the Working Note that may only be legible in their archival setting, such as when a different in ink or nib might indicate a distinct engagement with the note by Dickens (e.g., a reply to a query that is clearly made at a later time).\nOther annotations interpret the content of the Working Notes alongside the manuscript or corrected proofs. For example, some annotations describe how a name or phrase that appears on the Working Note is actually something Dickens arrives at through drafting and revision in the manuscript itself; this would suggest that the note is a record of a decision made in the process of composition, rather than a decision that preceded composition.\nSome annotations anchor a given serial installment in its moment of production by, for instance, providing relevant biographical information about Dickens’s movements or activities during a given period.\nFinally, some annotations interpret the Working Notes within the context of the novel as a whole, identifying patterns that suggest Dickens’s particular attention to a group of characters or plot thread, or interpreting notes as evidence of developments that Dickens considered or rejected.\nWhile each set of annotations is governed by consistent scholarly practices, they do not attempt to offer definitive interpretations of the significance of the Working Notes themselves. Rather, the descriptive, editorial, and interpretive commentary provided by the DDNP’s annotations provides users with new ways to access and explore Dickens’s compositional process and serial novels.\nWorks Cited\nLaing, Tony.

Digital Dickens Notes Project. Anna Gibson and Adam Grener, dirs. 2022.

By October, Dickens was discussing advertisements for the new novel with his publishers Bradbury and Evans, though no notice appeared until February 14, 1852, just two weeks before the first installment was published (Slater 337). But on December 7, 1851, Dickens informed Evans that he had “only the last short chapter to do, to complete No. I” (this chapter eventually became chapter 2; see BHWN01) (Letters 6.550).\n\nAs with his previous novel David Copperfield (1849-50)—as well as the earlier Martin Chuzzlewit (1843-44)—Dickens retained a series of sheets on which he tested different titles for the novel, sheets which are now bound with the manuscript and Working Notes for the novel. All but one of these sheets features “Tom-all-Alone's” as part of a possible title. This is usually accompanied by “The Ruined House” or “The Solitary House,” with “Building,” “Factory,” and “Mill” also appearing as alternatives. The central theme of Chancery also appears in most iterations, usually as “The Ruined House / That got into Chancery / And never got out.” Although the order of these sheets is uncertain, in Harry Stone’s speculative sequencing, the idea of the “East Wind” appears late in the process, before Dickens settled on “Bleak House and the East Wind” (Stone Working 185). This title appears on the headers of the Working Notes for the first two numbers, before Dickens finally landed on the shortened title Bleak House and amended the heading of the Working Note accordingly in finalizing the first installment. The heading on the Working Note for No. II still reads “Bleak House and the East Wind.”\n\nThat Dickens would eventually settle on “House” as part of the title is perhaps not surprising, given that late 1851 found him preoccupied with his move to Tavistock House in Bloomsbury, located a few kilometers north of Chancery Lane and the novel’s famous opening portrait of Holborn Hill. Dickens had secured a lease of the premises in July 1851, but oversaw extensive refurbishments before moving in (the family would live there until 1860). In October, Dickens was “wild to begin a new book” (Letters 6.506), but “the whirling of the story through one’s mind, escorted by workmen” (6.510) proved distracting. As he wrote to Burdett Coutts on the 8th of October (6.513):\nI have no news—except that I am three parts distracted and the fourth part wretched, in the agonies of getting into a new house—Tavistock House, Tavistock Square. Pending which desirable consummation of my troubles, I can not work at my new book—having all my notions of order turned completely topsy-turvy.\"\n\nWhile Dickens and his family had settled into Tavistock House by the end of 1851, the period of Bleak House’s composition through to the middle of 1853 involved movement. Dickens made trips to the provincial north with his amateur theatrical troupe to raise funds for the Guild of Literature and Art, which he founded along with Forster, Edward Bulwer Lytton and others in 1851 (see Hack). But Dickens also felt the need to flee London several times to focus on his novel, including trips to Folkestone in July 1852, Brighton in March 1853, and a longer stay in Boulogne from June 1853, where he wrote the last four monthly installments of Bleak House. This last trip was preceded by a period of significant illness, where Dickens spent six days “in bed, where [he] underwent great pain and became extremely weak” (Letters 7.95). Dickens was under great professional strain through these years. Alongside writing Bleak House, he was running Household Words, which was published weekly; writing A Child’s History of England, whose chapters appeared sporadically in Household Words from January 1851 through December 1853; working closely with Burdett Coutts on Urania Cottage and other philanthropic projects; and responding to various public engagements and invitations, many of which he declined, citing his commitments to Household Words and Bleak House.\n\nThe Critical and Popular Reception of Bleak House\nBuilding on the reputation Dickens had established with David Copperfield, Bleak House was a great popular success during its serial run. Sales for the novel were “markedly greater than that of any of the monthly serials written during the 1840s,” and initiated a sustained increase in sales that would continue through the remainder of his career (Patten 162). Based upon the sales of Copperfield, Bradbury and Evans ordered an initial printing of 25,000 copies of the first installment (168). However, those copies all sold by the end of the first day of March 1852, prompting a further printing of 5,000 copies and then another 2,000 (169). By Numbers IV and V, initial printings were up to 35,000 copies, and they remained at 34,000 through the completion of the novel’s serial publication. As Dickens wrote to Lavinia Watson upon completing the novel in August 1853: “It has retained its immense circulation from the first; beating dear old Copperfield by a round ten thousand and more. I have never had so many readers” (Letters 7.134).\nThe immediate critical response to Bleak House was, however, more mixed. As scholars have suggested, the turn in Dickens’s critical reception after mid-century may have followed from his “wide-sweeping criticism of society” that “alienated liberal and conservative alike” (Patten 162). Regardless, initial reviews of Bleak House found merit in passages and parts of the novel, with Inspector Bucket and Jo drawing particular praise. On the whole, though, reviewers found the novel lacking in coherence and plot. An unsigned review in the Illustrated London News (24 September 1853) claimed that “Mr Dickens fails in the construction of a plot” (Collins 281). Similarly, George Brimley, in an unsigned review in the Spectator (24 September 1853), wrote that the novel was “chargeable with not simply faults, but absolute want of construction” (283). Many reviewers cited Dickens’s “tendency to disagreeable exaggeration” in the novel’s characters (287) as well as its “entire absence of humour” (288). An unsigned review in Bentley’s Miscellany (October 1853) captures the tension between the novel’s commercial and critical reception: “Everybody reads—everybody admires—everybody is delighted—everybody loves—and yet almost everybody finds something to censure, something to condemn” (Collins 289).\nWhile these assessments generally appeared at the conclusion of the novel’s serial run, elements of the novel also elicited immediate response. One such element was the death of Krook by Spontaneous Combustion at the novel’s mid-point in No. X. In particular, George Henry Lewes criticized Dickens and his departure from scientific possibility in an article in The Leader on December 11, 1852. Dickens bolstered his defense of the death’s plausibility with a “heavy-handed” (Slater 349) description of the inquest in chapter 33 at the start of the next number (No. XI). This prompted further responses from Lewes in The Leader on the 5th and 12th of February, where he insisted that “the evidence in favour of the notion is worthless; that the theories in explanation are absurd; and that, according to all known chemical and physiological laws, Spontaneous Combustion is an impossibility” (Collins 275). Meanwhile, Dickens had consulted his friend Dr. John Elliotson, responding to him on the 7th of February (Letters 7.22):\nI am very truly obliged to you for the loan of your remarkable and learned lecture on Spontaneous Combustion; and I am not a little pleased to find myself fortified by such high authority. Before writing that chapter of Bleak House, I had looked up all the more famous cases you quote (as I dare say you divined in reading the description); but three or four of those you incidentally mention—two of them in 1820—are new to me. And your explanation is so beautifully clear, that I could particularly desire to refer to it several times before I come to the last No. and the Preface.\nDickens then responded at length in private letters to Lewes later in the month, and while he did not revisit the evidence within the novel itself, he did address the issue again–with direct reference to Lewes’s criticism–in the novel’s Preface (written at the end of its serialization) (see P. Denman, Haight).\n\nDickens’s biting critique of philanthropists such as Mrs. Jellyby, Mrs. Pardiggle, and Miss Wisk was another facet of the novel that provoked public response during its serial run. This reaction was in part generated through comparison with Harriet Beecher Stowe’s abolitionist novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Stowe’s novel appeared serially from June 1851 to April 1852, and was first published in England at the end of April, with advertisements appearing in the third monthly number of Bleak House (May 1852). In particular, during September and October 1852 Lord Thomas Denman published a series of articles in the London Standard that attacked Dickens by reviewing the first seven numbers of Bleak House alongside Stowe’s novel. Denman was Lord Chief Justice of England until 1850, a “tireless worker for legal reform and for abolition” (Stone \"Stowe\" 190), as well as a good friend of Dickens. In contrast to his exalted praise of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Denman took issue with Dickens’s satirical portrait of Mrs. Jellyby and her “telescopic philanthropy.” “We do not say,” Denman wrote, “that [Dickens] actually defends slavery or the slave-trade; but he takes pains to discourage, by ridicule, the effort now making to put them down” (T. Denman 9). Dickens was taken aback by these criticisms, and in writing to Denman’s daughter Margaret Cropper in December 1852 after Denman had suffered a series of strokes, Dickens praised him as “one of the noblest spirits in the world” but also rebutted his critiques. In regard to Mrs. Jellyby, Dickens wrote that she “gives offence merely because the word ‘Africa’, is unfortunately associated with her wild Hobby. No kind of reference to Slavery is made or intended, in that connexion” (Letters 6.825).\nUltimately, though, Dickens himself appears to have been pleased with his work as the novel’s composition and serial publication came to a conclusion. As he wrote to Lavinia Watson: “I like the conclusion very much and think it very pretty indeed. The story has taken extraordinarily—especially during the last five or six months when its purpose has been gradually working itself out” (Letters 7.134).\nThe Working Notes for Bleak House\nThe Working Notes for Bleak House suggest that Dickens began each number dividing it by default into three chapters. For installments that eventually became four chapters (Numbers I, IX, XIII, XIV, XVI), differences in ink and nib indicate that the chapter heading for the fourth chapter was always added later. This is most explicit in No. IX, where the headings for chapters 26-28 appear in blue ink, and the heading for chapter 29 is added at the bottom in black ink. Read alongside the manuscript and corrected proofs, the Working Notes also indicate that many of the chapter titles were conceived and added at a late stage in the compositional process. Around twenty chapter titles, for example, were added in ink to the type-set proofs, with Dickens usually returning to the manuscript and Working Notes to document those titles. For No. VII, only one chapter title (“A New Lodger,” chapter 20) appears in the manuscript, and this is in black ink where blue ink was used for the entire manuscript for the number. No chapter titles appear in the manuscript for No. XIII (chapter 39-42). One notable exception is chapters given the generic title “Esther’s Narrative.” Many of these chapter titles appear to have been written at the same time as the chapter headings on the Working Notes, with Dickens perhaps relying on this generic title to help him structure numbers by deciding early in the compositional process about shifts between the novel’s first- and third-person narration.\nWhile Dickens’s handling of the novel’s two modes of narration was largely an open question as composition proceeded month-by-month, the Working Notes provide plenty of evidence of Dickens’s careful handling and preparation of key elements of the plot. In the first half of the novel’s Working Notes, for example, we see indications of Dickens’s development of minor elements that will nevertheless become important later in the novel. These include the gradual developments in Richard’s character (Notes for Nos. III, VI, and VIII); the connection between Watt Rouncewell and Lady Dedlock’s maid Rosa that culminates in their marriage late in the novel (Notes for Nos. II, IV, VI, and IX); and the connections between Skimpole, the debt collector Coavinses, and Coavinses's daughter Charley, who will become Esther’s maid and the vector for her disfiguring illness (Notes for Nos. V, VI, VIII, and X). The middle sequence of the novel’s Notes also documents Dickens’s careful management of key developments: the gradual revelation of Esther’s love for Allan Woodcourt (Note V: “‘I have forgotten to mention – at least, I have not mentioned –’”); the disclosure, through the discoveries of Guppy and Tulkinghorn, that Lady Dedlock is Esther’s mother (Note for No. VII, where in “Mems: for future” Dickens works out these threads); and Esther’s infection with smallpox in No. X, which threatens to damage both her romantic prospects and her resemblance to Lady Dedlock. As Dickens wrote to Burdett Coutts in mid-November 1852 (following the completion of the composition of No. X): “I have been so busy, leading up to the great turning idea of the Bleak House story, that I have lived this last week or ten days in a perpetual scald and boil” (Letters 6.805). Yet while H.P. Sucksmith, in the first scholarly analysis of the Working Notes for Bleak House in 1965, highlights the Notes as “evidence of the control which Dickens regarded as one of the triumphs of his growing professionalism” (52), our annotations of these Working Notes also highlight evidence of uncertainty, spontaneity, and contingency in the composition of Bleak House.\nWorks Cited\nCollins, Philip, ed.

By October, Dickens was discussing advertisements for the new novel with his publishers Bradbury and Evans, though no notice appeared until February 14, 1852, just two weeks before the first installment was published (Slater 337). But on December 7, 1851, Dickens informed Evans that he had “only the last short chapter to do, to complete No. I” (this chapter eventually became chapter 2; see BHWN01) (Letters 6.550).\n\nAs with his previous novel David Copperfield (1849-50)—as well as the earlier Martin Chuzzlewit (1843-44)—Dickens retained a series of sheets on which he tested different titles for the novel, sheets which are now bound with the manuscript and Working Notes for the novel. All but one of these sheets features “Tom-all-Alone's” as part of a possible title. This is usually accompanied by “The Ruined House” or “The Solitary House,” with “Building,” “Factory,” and “Mill” also appearing as alternatives. The central theme of Chancery also appears in most iterations, usually as “The Ruined House / That got into Chancery / And never got out.” Although the order of these sheets is uncertain, in Harry Stone’s speculative sequencing, the idea of the “East Wind” appears late in the process, before Dickens settled on “Bleak House and the East Wind” (Stone Working 185). This title appears on the headers of the Working Notes for the first two numbers, before Dickens finally landed on the shortened title Bleak House and amended the heading of the Working Note accordingly in finalizing the first installment. The heading on the Working Note for No. II still reads “Bleak House and the East Wind.”\n\nThat Dickens would eventually settle on “House” as part of the title is perhaps not surprising, given that late 1851 found him preoccupied with his move to Tavistock House in Bloomsbury, located a few kilometers north of Chancery Lane and the novel’s famous opening portrait of Holborn Hill. Dickens had secured a lease of the premises in July 1851, but oversaw extensive refurbishments before moving in (the family would live there until 1860). In October, Dickens was “wild to begin a new book” (Letters 6.506), but “the whirling of the story through one’s mind, escorted by workmen” (6.510) proved distracting. As he wrote to Burdett Coutts on the 8th of October (6.513):\nI have no news—except that I am three parts distracted and the fourth part wretched, in the agonies of getting into a new house—Tavistock House, Tavistock Square. Pending which desirable consummation of my troubles, I can not work at my new book—having all my notions of order turned completely topsy-turvy.\"\n\nWhile Dickens and his family had settled into Tavistock House by the end of 1851, the period of Bleak House’s composition through to the middle of 1853 involved movement. Dickens made trips to the provincial north with his amateur theatrical troupe to raise funds for the Guild of Literature and Art, which he founded along with Forster, Edward Bulwer Lytton and others in 1851 (see Hack). But Dickens also felt the need to flee London several times to focus on his novel, including trips to Folkestone in July 1852, Brighton in March 1853, and a longer stay in Boulogne from June 1853, where he wrote the last four monthly installments of Bleak House. This last trip was preceded by a period of significant illness, where Dickens spent six days “in bed, where [he] underwent great pain and became extremely weak” (Letters 7.95). Dickens was under great professional strain through these years. Alongside writing Bleak House, he was running Household Words, which was published weekly; writing A Child’s History of England, whose chapters appeared sporadically in Household Words from January 1851 through December 1853; working closely with Burdett Coutts on Urania Cottage and other philanthropic projects; and responding to various public engagements and invitations, many of which he declined, citing his commitments to Household Words and Bleak House.\n\nThe Critical and Popular Reception of Bleak House\nBuilding on the reputation Dickens had established with David Copperfield, Bleak House was a great popular success during its serial run. Sales for the novel were “markedly greater than that of any of the monthly serials written during the 1840s,” and initiated a sustained increase in sales that would continue through the remainder of his career (Patten 162). Based upon the sales of Copperfield, Bradbury and Evans ordered an initial printing of 25,000 copies of the first installment (168). However, those copies all sold by the end of the first day of March 1852, prompting a further printing of 5,000 copies and then another 2,000 (169). By Numbers IV and V, initial printings were up to 35,000 copies, and they remained at 34,000 through the completion of the novel’s serial publication. As Dickens wrote to Lavinia Watson upon completing the novel in August 1853: “It has retained its immense circulation from the first; beating dear old Copperfield by a round ten thousand and more. I have never had so many readers” (Letters 7.134).\nThe immediate critical response to Bleak House was, however, more mixed. As scholars have suggested, the turn in Dickens’s critical reception after mid-century may have followed from his “wide-sweeping criticism of society” that “alienated liberal and conservative alike” (Patten 162). Regardless, initial reviews of Bleak House found merit in passages and parts of the novel, with Inspector Bucket and Jo drawing particular praise. On the whole, though, reviewers found the novel lacking in coherence and plot. An unsigned review in the Illustrated London News (24 September 1853) claimed that “Mr Dickens fails in the construction of a plot” (Collins 281). Similarly, George Brimley, in an unsigned review in the Spectator (24 September 1853), wrote that the novel was “chargeable with not simply faults, but absolute want of construction” (283). Many reviewers cited Dickens’s “tendency to disagreeable exaggeration” in the novel’s characters (287) as well as its “entire absence of humour” (288). An unsigned review in Bentley’s Miscellany (October 1853) captures the tension between the novel’s commercial and critical reception: “Everybody reads—everybody admires—everybody is delighted—everybody loves—and yet almost everybody finds something to censure, something to condemn” (Collins 289).\nWhile these assessments generally appeared at the conclusion of the novel’s serial run, elements of the novel also elicited immediate response. One such element was the death of Krook by Spontaneous Combustion at the novel’s mid-point in No. X. In particular, George Henry Lewes criticized Dickens and his departure from scientific possibility in an article in The Leader on December 11, 1852. Dickens bolstered his defense of the death’s plausibility with a “heavy-handed” (Slater 349) description of the inquest in chapter 33 at the start of the next number (No. XI). This prompted further responses from Lewes in The Leader on the 5th and 12th of February, where he insisted that “the evidence in favour of the notion is worthless; that the theories in explanation are absurd; and that, according to all known chemical and physiological laws, Spontaneous Combustion is an impossibility” (Collins 275). Meanwhile, Dickens had consulted his friend Dr. John Elliotson, responding to him on the 7th of February (Letters 7.22):\nI am very truly obliged to you for the loan of your remarkable and learned lecture on Spontaneous Combustion; and I am not a little pleased to find myself fortified by such high authority. Before writing that chapter of Bleak House, I had looked up all the more famous cases you quote (as I dare say you divined in reading the description); but three or four of those you incidentally mention—two of them in 1820—are new to me.
