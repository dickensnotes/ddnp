Arthur Clennam in his interview with his mother, and on his first opportunity after coming homed, asked her if it had every occurred to her to suspect that his father had unhappily wronged any one and made no reparation? Also reminded her with what Earnestness his father, dying, had given him his watch for her, containing the watchpaper "Do not forget," and had tried to write some word. Also, how that "I knew that your ascendency over him was the cause of his going to china to <look> take care of the business there, while you took care of it here"; and that "it was your will that I should remain with you until I was twenty, and then go to him as I did."

<Fa> Arthur's ^father's^ Uncle who had no other relation, left a will; <whi> by which he made him his sole heir, except a legacy of <a tho> two thousand guineas (?) to the girl, under the charge of <Frederick> Frederick Dorrit, or in default of her being alive to his youngest <Niece nearest Daughter, -> female relative, daughter or Niece. Mrs Clennam with-held this will - "I will make restitution when I see fit - <"> I will find it, one day . <"> He was not in his right <me> mind when he made it. It was weakness - imbecility."
